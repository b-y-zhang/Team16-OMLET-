VanHacks 2016

Adapted and extended an Andriod application to create a Form-based GUI with input validation, prerequisite checking, and data transformation. This is made for the Big Sisters of BC, where volunteers are able to sign up with any Andriod device, once the application gains access to the Big Sisters CRM. 

- The form will first prompt the user to answer preliminiary prerequisite questions, and will only direct them to the next part of the form if they are eligible to become a Big Sister
- The form will then collect the interested applicant's information, where each stage will track data input validation
- After the form is submitted, the data is packaged nicely into a .csv format that is ready to be uploaded to the CRM automatically, once access is given. 

Applications Used: Android Studio, GitHub for Desktop (iOS)
